.SH NAME
OWN_SH - Our own Emulator of the Linux Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
	command [command_options] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The utility of our Own Shell is to interpret the commands that it will execute, commands read from a command line string, standard input or a specified file. The application must make sure that the commands to be executed are in the PATH or other functions created by us from some original linux functions.
.P
Pathname expansion will not fail due to the size of a file.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B INTERACTIVE MODE
.nf
	When we run Our Shell, the following will appear:
	CURRENT USER: @humtej1204
	Shell-$
	
	If we write an existing command on the command line,
	our shell will execute the corresponding program:
	Shell-$ ls
	AUTHORS    Tests        external            get_cmd_path.c      
	help_files  main.c  	man_1_simple_shell  shell_IO.c  
	shell_str_parsing.c	string_methods.cREADME.md	built_ins.c
	get_buildint_cmd.c	handle_stat_codes.c	hsh	main.h
	mem_mgmt.c		shell_calls.c		signals_handler.c
	Shell-$
	
	If we write a command that does not exist on the
	command line, our shell will give us an error message:
	Shell-$ asd
	Command not found!
	Shell-$
